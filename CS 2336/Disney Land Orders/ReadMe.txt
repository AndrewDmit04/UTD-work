This project is focused on keeping track of customers and their orders.
There are three categories of customers, regular, gold and platinum. 
A customer is upgraded to gold when they have spent over 50 dollars.
A gold customer gets a discount based on how much they have spent so far.
If they have spent over 50 and below 100 they get 5% off.
If they have spent over 100 and below 150 they get 10% off. 
If they have spent over 150 and below 200 they get 15% off. 
If the customer spends over 200 they are upgraded to platinum. 
Platinum does not get a discount but gets a bonus dollar for every 5 dollars the customer spends. 

The program starts with three inputs which are cusomer.dat which contains all the regular customers.
file preffered.dat file which contains all the golds and pllatinum customers.
and the orders.dat file which contains the orders of the customers.

The Program will process the orders.dat file and update the amount spend as well as the status if needed. 
The program will end by writing to the output.dat which contains all the regular customers and output1.dat which contains all the preffered customers.
