This Java program manages an auditorium booking system. 
It reads an auditorium layout from a file, allows users to reserve seats based on their preferences 
(row, seat, number of adult, child, and senior tickets), and keeps track of ticket sales. 
The program also suggests the best available seats based on the middle of the auditorium and allows them to confirm or decline the booking. 
It employs file input/output, user input validation, and various methods to handle seat reservations and output statistics. 
The ticket prices are fixed, with different prices for adult, child, and senior tickets.
