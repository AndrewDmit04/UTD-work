This project uses a linked list to create a movie theatre and take reservetions of seats.
It will print out the audotorium with row numbers and seat letters and allow the user to select which seats they want. 
After they select the seat if they are avalible the program will reserve the seats and if not it will find the best avalible seats closest to the middle.
The user will be prompted if they would like to reserve those seats. 
At the end of the program the total tickets sold will be listed as well as the sales, and the final audotroium will be printed to a output file.
