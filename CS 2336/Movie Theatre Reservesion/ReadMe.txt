This project uses a linked list to create a movie theatre and take reservations of seats.
It will print out the auditorium with row numbers and seat letters and allow users to select seats. 
After they select the seat if they are avalible the program will reserve the seats and if not it will find the best available seats closest to the middle.
The user will be prompted if they would like to reserve those seats. 
At the end of the program, the total tickets sold will be listed as well as the sales, and the final auditorium will be printed into an output file.
