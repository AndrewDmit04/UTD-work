Objective:
Write a program that asks the user for a string and validates it as a password according to the rules given below.  
If the user enters a blank line (New Line character in the first byte) the program exits.  
Otherwise, it should continue asking for passwords and validating them.  
Note that the user can type anything, so you must check for validity.  
If the password is valid, print “Valid password.”  If it isn’t, print “Invalid password.”  
There is no need to explain why it is not valid.
Rules:
1.	Passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters long and no more than 50 characters long.
2.	They must contain at least one upper-case letter.
3.	They must contain at least one lower-case letter.
4.	They must contain at least one digit (0-9)
5.	They must contain at least one special character from the set !@#$%^&()[],.:;
6.	They must not contain any special characters not in the above set, and they must not contain spaces.
